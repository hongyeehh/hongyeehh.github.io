Welcome!
======

I am Ye Hong, currently a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, working in the [Mobility Information Engineering (MIE) Lab](http://mie-lab.ethz.ch/) at the [Chair of Geoinformation Engineering](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/). I obtained my doctoral degree in Geomatics, ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Martin Raubal](https://www.raubal.ethz.ch/) and [Konrad Schindler](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=143986). Previously, I earned my master's degree in Geomatic from ETH Zurich and a bachelor's degree in GIS and RS from Sun Yat-sen University, China. 

I have a keen interest in human mobility, urban computing, and network science, with a particular focus on leveraging computational methods such as ML and DL to address real-world challenges that impact daily lives. My current research centers on predicting and modeling individual mobility, with the goal of promoting personalized travel options and supporting a smooth transition toward sustainable transportation systems.
