Welcome!
======

I am Ye Hong, a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich, affiliated with the [Mobility Information Engineering (MIE) Lab](http://mie-lab.ethz.ch/) at the [Chair of Geoinformation Engineering](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/). I also hold a joint appointment at the University of Zurich's Department of Geography, where I work with the [Urban Analytics Group](https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/una.html).

I received my Doctor of Science degree from ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Prof. [Martin Raubal](https://www.raubal.ethz.ch/) and Prof. [Konrad Schindler](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=143986). Before that, I obtained a master's degree in Geomatics from ETH Zurich and a bachelor's degree in Geographic Information Science and Remote Sensing from Sun Yat-sen University, China.

My research interests lie at the intersection of human mobility, urban computing, and network science. My work centers on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to understand, predict, and model individual mobility behavior. The overarching aim of my work is to develop computational frameworks that enable personalized travel solutions and facilitate the transition toward sustainable and intelligent transportation systems.
